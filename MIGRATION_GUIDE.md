# Migration Guide: v1.x to v2.0.0

## üö® Breaking Changes

1. **Database Location Changed** (Security Fix)
   - Old: `/tmp/ipc-messages.db` (world-readable)
   - New: `~/.claude-ipc-data/messages.db` (secure permissions)
   
2. **UV Package Manager** is Now Primary Installation Method
   - Faster and more reliable than pip
   - Better dependency resolution

3. **Coordinated Restart Required**
   - ALL IPC instances must restart to use v2.0.0
   - The old server cannot provide new security features

## üìã Upgrade Steps

### Step 1: Coordinate the Restart

**IMPORTANT**: All AI instances must restart together. The IPC network will be temporarily unavailable during this process.

1. Notify all users that a restart is required
2. Have everyone stop their IPC instances
3. Update to v2.0.0
4. First instance to start (Claude, Gemini, or any MCP-enabled AI) becomes the new secure server

### Step 2: Clean Old Installation

```bash
# For Claude Code users
pip uninstall claude-ipc-mcp
rm -rf ~/.venv  # if you had a venv

# For everyone
rm ~/.ipc-session  # Clear old session
```

### Step 3: Install UV (if needed)

```bash
# Linux/macOS/WSL
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Step 4: Install v2.0.0

```bash
# For Claude Code users
uv pip install claude-ipc-mcp

# For MCP configuration
claude mcp install claude-ipc-mcp
```

### Step 5: Database Migration

**Note**: Messages do NOT automatically migrate for security reasons.

- Old messages remain in `/tmp/ipc-messages.db`
- New messages go to `~/.claude-ipc-data/messages.db`
- If you need old messages, manually copy the database:

```bash
# Optional: Backup old messages
cp /tmp/ipc-messages.db ~/ipc-messages-backup.db

# The new database will be created automatically on first use
```

## ü§ñ Special Instructions for Non-MCP Users

### Gemini CLI Users

**üéØ NEW**: Gemini CLI with MCP support can now be the server/broker!

If you're using Google Gemini:

1. **With MCP Support** - Gemini is a full participant and can be the server
   - Configure MCP in settings.json (see [GEMINI_SETUP.md](docs/GEMINI_SETUP.md))
   - First Gemini to start can become the broker
   - Has identical capabilities to Claude Code

2. **With Python Scripts** - Still fully compatible as a client
   - Your scripts work with v2.0.0
   - Can connect to any server (Claude, Gemini, or other)

### Other AI Platforms

Any AI platform with MCP support can act as the server. The first instance to start becomes the broker, regardless of which AI platform it is. Platforms using Python scripts can connect as clients.

## ‚ú® What's New in v2.0.0

### Security Improvements (Verified by Professional Audit)
- Database in secure location with proper permissions
- Session tokens hashed with SHA-256
- 24-hour token expiration
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
- Path traversal protection

### Features
- Messages persist across server restarts
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- Better error handling and logging

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" after upgrade
- Ensure at least one Claude Code instance is running
- Check that old instances are fully stopped
- Verify port 9876 is not blocked

### Missing messages after upgrade
- This is expected - messages don't auto-migrate
- Check `/tmp/ipc-messages.db` for old messages
- New messages will appear in the secure database

### Gemini can't start server
- This is a known limitation
- Ensure a Claude Code instance starts first
- See [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for future plans
